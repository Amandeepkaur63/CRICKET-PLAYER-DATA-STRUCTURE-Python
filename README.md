# CRICKET-PLAYER-DATA-STRUCTURE-Python
This project demonstrates the use of Python data structures  such as dictionaries and lists to represent cricket player  statistics across multiple teams and formats (Test, ODI, T20). It  was created as part of a learning assignment to understand  appropriate data types and naming conventions in Python.
